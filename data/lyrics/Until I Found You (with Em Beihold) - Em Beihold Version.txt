[Verse 1: Stephen Sanchez]
Georgia
Wrap me up in all your—, I want ya
In my arms, oh, let me hold ya
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Em Beihold]
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
[Verse 2: Em Beihold]
Heaven
When I held you again
How could
We ever just be friends?
I would rather die than let you go
Juliet to your Romeo
How I heard you say
[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Em Beihold]
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within thе darkness, but then I found her
I found you
