[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, oâ€”
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, 
Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis
]
20/20, 20/20 
vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with 
precision, 
I
Wonder if you look 
both ways 
when you cross 
my mind
 (Yeah)
I said, I said
I'm 
sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasin'
You're the one that's always running through my 
daydream, I
I can only see 
your face
 when I close 
my eyes
(Uh-huh)
[Chorus: Kali Uchis & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
Can I get a kiss? (
Ah
)
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (
Uh-huh
)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up
