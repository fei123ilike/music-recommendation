[Verse 1]
I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
I'm sayin', "see you again" so many times it's becomin' my tag line
But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than try to catch this flight
So many things I'd rather say
But for now, it's "goodbye"
[Pre-Chorus]
You say I'm always leavin'
You, when you're sleepin' alone
But the car's outside
But I don't wanna go tonight
[Chorus]
I'm not gettin' in the 
Addison Lee
Unless you pack your bags
You're comin' with me
I'm tired of lovin' from afar
And never being where you are
Close the windows, lock the doors
Don't wanna leave you anymore
[Verse 2]
I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
It's an unfamiliar feelin', but I know it so well
Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
Than this mobile in my hand
But I guess it'll do
'Cause for you, I would run up my phone bill
