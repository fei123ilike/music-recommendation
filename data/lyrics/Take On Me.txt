[Verse 1]
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shyin' away
I'll be comin' for your love, okay?
[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
[Verse 2]
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumblin' away
Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"
[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
