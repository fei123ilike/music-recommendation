[Intro]
Kido, Kido
K-K-Kido on the beat, better run it back
[Verse 1]
Fuckin' 
Robitussin
I don't know why this shit got me lazy right now, yeah
Can't do Percocets or Molly (Molly)
I'm turnin' one, tryna live it up here right, right, right
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place
[Chorus]
You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body lightweight, speaks to me
[Post-Chorus]
('Cane on it)
Yeah
Yeah (Yeah)
