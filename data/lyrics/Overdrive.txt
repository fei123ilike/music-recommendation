[Chorus]
I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so overtired
And there's nowhere I can hide
Now I live my life on overdrive
[Verse 1]
I could be more like him if that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you
[Chorus]
I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so uninspired
There ain't no angels in this world
So I live my life on overdrive
[Verse 2]
I'd remove my tattoos if that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you, uh
[Outro]
I could end it with her if that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
