[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, um (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
