[Intro: Aran]
La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
[Verse 1: Aran, 
All
]
A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign
(
Oh why, oh why? Oh why, oh why?
)
[Pre-Chorus: Sio, 
All
]
I'm feelin' lonely (
Lonely
)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (
Hold me
)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (
Say what you say, but I want it more
)
But still, I want it more, more, more
[Chorus: All]
I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
[Verse 2: Aran]
I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?
