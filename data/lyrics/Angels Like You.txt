[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, 
only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
