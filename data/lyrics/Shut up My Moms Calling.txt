[Hook]
I just want to rewind, I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell
That it isn't you, so, baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me
[Chorus]
Baby, come home (So, baby, won't you say some?), home
Baby, come home (So, baby, won't you say some?), home
Baby, come home (So, baby, won't you say some?), home
Baby, come home (So, baby, won't you say some?), home
[Hook]
I just want to rewind, I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell
That it isn't you, so, baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me
