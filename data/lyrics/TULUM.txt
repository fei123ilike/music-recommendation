[Intro: Payo Solís]
Hey Peso, there's something I want to tell that girl over there
[Verse 1: Payo Solís & 
Peso Pluma
]
You're a ten, but you're still with that guy
Who doesn't even come close to your level, he doesn't seem like your type
So many vacation photos from Tulum
But I know your heart isn't really into it
Baby, you were wasting your time
It's good I showed up in time
[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma & 
Payo Solís
]
Baby, what I was missing was you
You're the most delicious thing on the menu
Tell him goodbye, you're already convinced
Baby, what I was missing was you
You're the most delicious thing on the menu
Tell him goodbye, you're already convinced
[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Payo Solís]
Tell him you have another man, if you want, tell him my name
Food gets cold when it's left unattended
Say you have another man, if you want, tell him my name
Food gets cold when it's left unattended
[Interlude: Julián Peña Jr. & 
Peso Pluma
]
And this is Grupo Frontera
Bye!
And the Double P
Ya-ya-ya
