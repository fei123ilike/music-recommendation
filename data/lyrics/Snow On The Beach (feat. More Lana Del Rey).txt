[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
[Chorus: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey
]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, 
Lana Del Rey
]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, 
ah
, ah
