[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & 
Blessd
]
They keep coming in
Bills come and bills go
Wearing Jordans
I'm ready, just tell me the plan
The mood is bossed up
They want my ice and also the shampoo
From Medellín to Moscow
It was recorded in 4K and uploaded to YouTube
[Chorus: Peso Pluma, 
Blessd
 & 
Both
]
The girls kiss me, I drive them all crazy
They kiss, they dance, and they get all riled up
They don't need flowers, just a hit of the 2CB
And I'm still blessed, with my own path, oh
[Interlude: Blessd & 
Peso Pluma
]
Pure Doble P, fuck it, man
Haha
From Medellín, you know? Hehe
Bye!
 (Made in Medеllín)
From the Antioquia neighborhood with El Bendito
Purе Doble P
[Verse 2: Blessd & 
Peso Pluma
]
Baguettes on my bracelet, chain, and rings
I didn't inherit them as a kid, I had to fight for them
That's why the girls are crazy about me, because they know what I carry, that I bring long money, there's plenty to spend
Girls on top of me, my gang, and everything I have around my neck
(That's why I blow them away in my room and that little ass gets the stamp)
