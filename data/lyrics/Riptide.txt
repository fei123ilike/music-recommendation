[Verse 1]
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turnin' green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
And they come unstuck
[Chorus]
Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
[Verse 2]
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's runnin' from himself
And she's been livin' on the highest shelf
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
And they come unstuck
