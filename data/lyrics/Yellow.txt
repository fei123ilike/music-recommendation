[Intro: Young Chris]
Uh
[Verse: Young Chris, 
Wale
]
Good endurance, I run it up with Folarin
I could be your lover
Out in public though, I gotta be your brother
Don't need 'em to think other
Okay, you can be my girl, flick bird at the informants
City girls cool but she fruitful as any farmer
Truthful, ain't too religious, but prey on niggas that want her
I pray the woman I like get right with my baby mother
Like Annalise Keating, she is decent, still kept her body like—
Used to hustle out the Marquis, built the stash in the Caddy
Poverty had me, success grabbed me
Raised in the streets, the absence of my daddy
Hustle substituted, no computer, I'm corner savvy, mm
Dirty Harry, you could bloody Mary
Family funeral, no Tyler Perry
Six homies to carry, cemetery to bury
Creepin' where you sleep like the ferret, don't lose your teeth
Yeah, my soldiers is militant, military, we do retreat
This shit deep, nigga (
Yeah
)
You street fightin' like V-Trigger
Shoutout Malik, you gon' die if you don't eat, nigga
Elevate all times, watchin' the streets trickle
Down, nigga, you clown niggas ain't me, nigga
I'm God-gifted, I'm different
I'm complicated, they simple
My competition been constipated
See, y'all only shit through, it's hard shit you ain't been through
Y'all cut at the scrimmage, you far, far from official
I got bitches that brag for me, you braggin' a b—
Yellow flag, where it is?
Caravan full of the homies (
Brrt
), calibers filled with extensions
AK filled with bananas, guerrillas peelin' them bitches
Knee-deep in the trenches, fiends stickin' syringes
For my ninjas in the yard where they barbwire the fences
I'ma kill every guard in position and the witness
Just need the drop to the exact location, attack formation
Send 'em to maintenance, leavin' vacant while vacation
That's what happen when you leak information
Know we two of the best
Quit imitating, nigga (
Ayy, nah, nah
), show some respect (
Look
)
Take the good (
Yeah
)
