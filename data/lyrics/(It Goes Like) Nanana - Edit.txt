[Pre-Chorus]
I can't explain
I got a feeling that I just, I can't erase
Just a feeling that I won't, won't leave behind
Because it's something that is on, it's on my mind
I guess it goes like
[Chorus]
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't explain
I got a feeling that I just, I can't erase
Just a feeling that I won't, won't leave behind
Because it's something that is on, it's on my mind
I guess it goes like
[Chorus]
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
