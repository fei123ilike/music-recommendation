[Intro: J. Cole]
Durkio told me he been on some positive shit, yeah, yeah
Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge
[Chorus: Choir & 
Lil Durk
]
All my life (
All my life
)
They been tryin' to keep me down (
They been tryna keep me down
)
All this time (
All this time
)
Never thought I would make it out (
Never thought I'd make it out
)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break mе (
No, no
)
They couldn't take me, thеy couldn't take me (
No
)
All my life (
All my life
)
They been tryin' to keep me down (
They been tryna keep me down
)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but
