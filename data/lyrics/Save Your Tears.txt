[Intro]
Ooh
Na-na, yeah
[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
