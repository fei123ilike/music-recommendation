[Intro: Duki]
This is the Big One
 (Wow)
I invite you to take a walk with The Ones from Space
Girls get strong, although, they don't go to the gym
Boys go crazy, they don’t feel tired
Tonight, I take you with me and we shut the case
[Pre-Chorus: Emilia]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I waited all day long for night to come and now
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
The night doesn't end until the sun rises
[Chorus: Tiago PZK, 
FMK
 & 
LIT killah
]
And in slow motion, you stayed with me and you didn't even realize
That tonight you let go
I know it tempts you, you asked me for a Fernet, I did it for you 70-30
The party bursts
And in slow motion, you stayed with me and you didn’t even realizе
That tonight you let go
I know it tempts you, you asked mе for a Fernet, I did it for you 70-30
The party bursts

[Verse 1: LIT killah]
She left with The Ones from Space
She came home without Waze, to meet face to face
Give me the OK or send me location
You get triple X like XXXTENTACION, mommy
We threw an after-party in the house, dancing reggaetón and house
On your body, I signed "MAWZ"
My-My love, where are we going?
I take you to Miami to spend the summer
To a faraway place, you and me, hand in hand
You are from space, you are from another plane, oh-oh
