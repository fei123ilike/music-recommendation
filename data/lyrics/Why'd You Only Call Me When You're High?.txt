[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you
[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"
[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas
[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
"Why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
"Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?"
