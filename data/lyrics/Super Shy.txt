I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도, you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도

ou're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
[Verse 1: Hyein,

And I wanna go out with you
Where you wanna go? (Huh?)
Find a lil spot, just sit and talk
Looking pretty, follow me
우리 둘이 나란히
보이지? (봐)
내 눈이 (Heh)
갑자기, 빛나지
When you say I'm your dream
[Refrain: Hanni,

You don't even know my name, do ya?
You don't even know my name, do ya?
