[Verse 1]
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above
[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark
[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
[Bridge]
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
Come out and haunt me
