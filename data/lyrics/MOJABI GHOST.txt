[Intro]
Eh-eh, ey, ey
Mojave Ghost, and on the street today I'm going out again, hey
I like both of you, we're going to my bed, all three of us
[Chorus]
Smoking, drinking, fucking, pretending that I don't think about you no more
I don't know who I'm lying to if this feeling keeps me up at night
Smoking, drinking, fucking, pretending that I don't think about you no more
I don't know who I'm lying to if this feeling keeps me up at night
[Post-Chorus]
And I hope, I hope
That today I dream of you, that today I dream beautifully
And I hope, I hope
That today I dream of you, that today I dream of you, oh
[Verse 1]
Hey, don't let the note show
You do know, don't wear yourself out
For the disco and for the boats
The asses and the asses
My heart is barren
Alone for thе Moncler
And a heavy flow, like John Eric
A lot of monеy, but
