[Verse 1]
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flyin' overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead
[Pre-Chorus]
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
Oh, sing it to me
[Chorus]
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
How do you like me now?
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
How do you like me now?
[Verse 2]
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said
