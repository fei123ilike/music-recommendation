[Verse 1]
If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away
[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
[Chorus]
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
[Verse 2]
If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you
