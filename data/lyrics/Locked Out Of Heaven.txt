[Verse 1]
Never had much faith in love or miracles (Uh)
Never wanna put my heart on the line (Uh)
But swimmin' in your water's somethin' spiritual (Uh)
I'm born again every time you spend the night, â€”ight (Uh)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked outta heaven
For too long
For too long
