[Pre-Chorus: Milo j]
Girl, rarely did I see you happy with him
I don't know, I'm not gonna get involved, but I noticed something dishonest about you
When I kissed you, I felt that you felt something
Then I knew that
[Chorus: Milo j]
You are what gives me peace, what I was looking for
And that happiness that makes me smile
I want to see you happy, better if it's by my side
Unconditional love, like a dog to its owner, I keep loving you
You are what gives me peace, what I was looking for
And that happiness that makes me smile
I want to see you happy, better if it's by my side
Unconditional love, like a dog to its ownеr, I keep loving you
[Verse: Milo j]
Lady with fame, high class in bed, and a broken hеart
Phone full of fans calling, and only mine gets answered
Let's see each other in the cold or heat, picnic, Netflix, I'll take the train
In ten or fifteen, I'll be there, and being honest, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Milo j]
Girl, rarely did I see you happy with him
I don't know, I'm not gonna get involved, but I noticed something dishonest about you
When I kissed you, I felt that you felt something
Then I knew that
