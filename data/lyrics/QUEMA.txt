[Intro: Ryan Castro & 
Peso Pluma
]
How cool, SOG
Ghetto Star
Zaga
The Double P
Zaga zaga zaga zau
Pu-pu-pum!
[Chorus: Ryan Castro & 
Peso
 Pluma
]
Little eyes (
Yeah, yeah
), a gaze that makes you fall in love
A body that's a candle and burns you, burns you (
Ah
)
I took a puff of inhalants (
Yeah, yeah, yeah; uh-huh
), I thought there was a problem (
Yeah
)
What I didn't know is that she burns, burns
[Post-Chorus: Peso Pluma, 
Peso Pluma & Ryan Castro
]
That's me, the one who sees you and covers you with kisses
The one you call if you want sex
I'm your singer, a naughty boy
I want that big ass
 (Bye), 
that fat ass
[Verse 1: Ryan Castro]
I love you (Pu), what a great view (Pu-pu; ha, ha, ah)
The best one is you and she ain't got no boyfriend
And if she's single, she should let herself loose (Zaga)
'Cause tonight there won't be any videos or pictures
