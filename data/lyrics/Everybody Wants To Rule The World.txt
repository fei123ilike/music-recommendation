[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
[Chorus]
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world
[Verse 2]
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the
[Chorus]
Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
[Bridge]
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
