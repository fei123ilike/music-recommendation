[Intro]
(
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
