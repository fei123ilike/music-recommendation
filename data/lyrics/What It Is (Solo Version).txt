[Chorus: Doechii]
What it is, ho? What's up?
Every good girl needs a little thug
Every block boy needs a little love
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up
[Verse 1: Doechii]
Can't you see it's just me and you?
Panoramic view, that's my point of view, bae
All about me, that's the energy
That's that lemon pepper thing, I'm a ten-piece, baby
[Pre-Chorus: Doechii]
Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo
[Chorus: Doechii]
What it is, ho? (
What it is?
) What's up? (
What's up?
)
Every good girl needs a little thug (
Thug
)
Every block boy needs a little love (
Love
)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (
Ayy
), up (
Ayy
)
What it is, ho? (
What it is?
) What's up? (
What's up?
)
Every good girl needs a little thug (
Thug
)
Every block boy needs a little love (
Love
)
If you put it down, I'ma pick it up, up (
Ayy
), up (
Ayy
)
