[Chorus: Peso Pluma]
Dom PÃ©rignon Lady Gaga, glasses on my face, 2C and acetone-washed
Triple washed, and a bad bitch calling me, they want my money
And it ain't bad, 'cause she seduces me like an animal
None of them post anything to Instagram, they just enjoy, they just enjoy
[Verse 1: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Junior H
]
Only famous influencers, the ones that we take and fly out
Private islands on a yacht, we spent them bands without crying
I'm gonna party, pink powder, dab pen
That waist is worth 30K, you can't afford it, you won't be able to
Living in San Andreas, but for real, whips and cash
They put three stars on me, get the cheat-code quickly, we lost 'em
2C and cocaine
I like the Lambo, but I use the Mercedes
That one's very beautiful and lets herself be loved
She likes hundred dollar bills, she wants my Cartier
[Refrain: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Peso Pluma
]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
[Interlude: Gabito Ballesteros, 
Junior H
 & 
Peso Pluma
]
And just like that, compa Peso, compa Junior
Compa Gabito, Double P, uh
Cha-chau!
Double P all the way, man
Let's keep on killing it, compa Junior
Compa Gabito
