[Intro]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
[Verse 1]
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'
[Chorus]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
