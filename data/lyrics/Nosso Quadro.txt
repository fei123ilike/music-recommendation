[Verse 1]
Everyone has a love that when they lie down and look at the ceiling
The question comes up, "Would it work out if it were today?"
In an episode that will never be released, an incomplete album
A story that stopped halfway through, can you imagine the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
Eh, longing that takes, that takes, that takes over me
And it gives me no remorse, no anger, no hatred of the pity, of the end
[Chorus]
Now our picture, gеtting married in the church
Won't be hung, only еxists in my head
The two of us herding cattle, the drover daughter
Our life in the bush, only exists in my head
But is it love even if it's not a lifetime?
But is it love even if it's not a lifetime?
(Ay, ay, ah, ay)
[Interlude]
Is it love or isn't it?
[Verse 2]
There are things we can't forget even if we want to
End of the year 2017
I'm starting dental school and you're in vet school
Your jeans shirt in my truck
My friends ask "what happened to you?
My father doesn't give up, still wants to be a grandfather
Time hasn't been so kind to both of us
It could have been, but it wasn't
