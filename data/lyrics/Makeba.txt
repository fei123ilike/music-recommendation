[Intro]
Ooh-ee
Ooh-ee
[Chorus]
Ooh-ee, Makeba
Makeba, ma che bella
Can I get a "Ooh-ee"? Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooh-ee, Makeba
Makeba, ma che bella
Can I get a "Ooh-ee"? Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooh-ee, Makeba
Makeba, ma che bella
Can I get a "Ooh-ee"? Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooh-ee, Makeba
Makeba, ma che bella
Can I get a "Ooh-ee"? Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
[Verse 1]
I wanna hear your breath just next to my soul
I wanna feel oppressed without any rest
I wanna see you sing, I wanna see you fight
'Cause you are the real beauty of human right
