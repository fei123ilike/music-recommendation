[Intro: Libianca]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Mhmm, mhmm
From Bamenda, it's Libianca
Oh-oh (
A-yo, Mage, you made a bang
)
[Refrain: Libianca]
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now, did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now, did you notice me?
[Verse 1: Libianca]
Nobody wey know the paranoia oh
'Cause I put a smile on my face
A façade you can never face (Ooh)
And if you don't know me well, well, oh
You won't see how buried I am inside my grave
Inside my grave
[Chorus: Libianca]
'Cause you see peoplе, people, peoplе, people
Don't really know you
They don't really know you
'Cause you see people, people, people
They don't really know you
They don't really know—
