[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise along the coast
As we're both getting old
I can't describe what I'm feeling
And all I know is we're going home
So, please don't let me go
Don't let me go
[Chorus]
And if it's right, I don't care how long it takes
As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears, it'll be okay
All I know is you're here with me
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh
I can't describe, oh-oh
I wish I could live through every memory
 
again
Just one more time before we float off in the wind
And all the time we spent waiting for the light to take us in
Have been the greatest moments of my life
