[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & 
Natanael Cano
]
I wake up, shower and I rgll up
It's poison, gets you high, of very good quality
Phones never stop ringing
If it's not some chick, it's because a client wants more
[Chorus: Peso Pluma & 
Natanael Cano
]
And well wrapped up the packages go
No worries, I can't fail
I'm always ready to cross
Powder, rounds and crystal too
The paperatcomes and goes
The chicks go so crazy
We enjoy it, good or bad
I won't complain about this life
[Interlude: Natanael Cano]
¡Eah!
And very drunk with the double P
The corridos tumbados, just like that bro
[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & 
Peso Pluma
]
Fressedhth the Balenciagas, bad ass corridos blasting
The girls dancing so well and I'm silver, LV
I feel like I'm already flying bro
And herе we will never complain
Why would wе turn back? Fuck it I'm going all the way
