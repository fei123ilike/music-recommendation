[Intro]
Bizarrap, ja
Ra-Rauw
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, let's find an excuse to meet
Just tell me (Wuh) the time, I've got the place
She moved close to me (Wuh), I'll be there in ten, no need for a GPS (Ah!)
I know by heart the route to her body (Yah!)
[Chorus]
Baby, hello
It was because of the story that you uploaded to your close friends
I saw that you were lonely and I wanted to beauty and turn on (Hey, hey)
Let's remember the motel timеs
Baby, hello
It was because of thе story that you uploaded to your close friends
I saw that you were lonely and I wanted to beauty and turn on
Let's remember the motel times (Ra-Rauw)
[Verse 1]
You and I have something pending (Hey)
Baby, don't leave me waiting (No)
Let's go get another friendly fuck (Ah)
In the backseat of the Bentley (Hey)
She likes tanning, training, Skims and Fenty (Wuh-uh)
Nothing fake, her body is authentic (Ih-ih)
And he's almost touching the thirties (Ah)
And if we get together we're caffeine with mate
I gave her a board, she said “checkmate” (Hey)
I got her doing yoga and pilates (Mommy), hey
I brought her to smoke, yeah, yeah, I want her to snatch you, eh
I'm gonna get us out of here, don't ask me to stop
(When I kill you in bed)
