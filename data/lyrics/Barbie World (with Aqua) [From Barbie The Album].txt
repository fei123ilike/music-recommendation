[Intro: Aqua & Ice Spice]
I'm always yours, ooh-oh (stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)
[Chorus: Ice Spice]
And I'm bad like the Barbie (Barbie)
I'm a doll but I still wanna party (party)
Pink 'Vette like I'm ready to bend (bend)
I'm a ten, so I pull in a Ken
Like Jazzie, Stacie, Nicki (grrah)
All of the Barbies is pretty (damn)
All of the Barbies is bad
It girls, and we ain't playin' tag (grrah)
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Rad, but he spank me when I get bad
I'm in LA, Rodeo Drive
I'm in New York, Madison Ave
I'm a Barbie girl (girl), pink Barbie Dreamhouse
The way Ken be killin' shit
Got me yellin' out like the scream housе (woo)
Yellin' out, we ain't sellin' out
Wе got money but we ain't lendin' out
We got bars but we ain't bailin' out
In that pink Ferrari, we peelin' out
I told Tae bring the Bob Dylan out
That pussy so cold, we just chillin' out
They be yellin', yellin', ye-yellin' out
It's Barbie, bitch, if you still in doubt (oh)
