[Intro]
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
[Refrain]
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh (
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
)
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh (
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
)
(
You could 
bet
 that, never gotta sweat that
) Yeah
[Verse 1]
If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band
You be the match, I will be a fuse, boom!
Painter, baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard, you can be the talk
And I can be the walk, yeah-eah
[Chorus]
Even when the sky comes fallin'
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We could do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing, yeah
