[Verse 1: August Alsina]
A nigga back with the motherfuckin' remix (Remix) and we 'bout to kill this shit (Oh)
See I went and got a little help to get the whole club poppin' like Freaknik
'Cause I got Rozay, a little Bombay, a little peach Ciroc and we faded
Soon as we step in, we got your chick and yo' chick and yo' chick and I know you hate it
'Cause we linin' up the shots (Shots)
Youngin' got the heat to make 'em pop
Soon as we hit the parkin' lot
Then we see all the panties drop
Girl, ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
Your bitch choosin' on a real nigga, let her chill nigga, that's real
'Cause I'm so fucked up, now I'm talkin' my shit
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
This is what you want, I'ma put it like this
Lay it down to the Aug', Trey and Chris remix
