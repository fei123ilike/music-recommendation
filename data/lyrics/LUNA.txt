[Intro: Junior H]
Moon, you tell her
That you are the only one
Who can see her
Ah-ah
[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & 
Junior H
]
Moon, you tell her
That you are the only one that can see her
In the landscape when the tide was high you were a shooting star
[Chorus: Peso Pluma]
Take care of her
My moon, you'll always see her
Tell her that she won't see me
But you'll be there
[Interlude: Junior H & 
Peso Pluma
]
Uh!
Buddy Junior
Keep killing it, dude
For the girls
Pure Double P, little girl
Chau
