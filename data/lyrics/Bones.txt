[Verse 1]
Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?
[Chorus]
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones
[Verse 2]
Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
There was nevеr gray in black and white
There was never wrong till there was right (Ooh-ooh)
Feelin' like a bould
e
r hurtlin'
Seein' all the vultures circlin'
Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
Turnin
' in a bed, that's darkenin'
