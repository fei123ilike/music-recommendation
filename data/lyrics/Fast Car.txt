[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove
[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'
[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school and that's what I did
