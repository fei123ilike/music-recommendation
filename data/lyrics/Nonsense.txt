[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, la-la)
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)
[Chorus]
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
