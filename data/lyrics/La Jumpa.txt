Woo-ooh!
[Verse 1: Arc치ngel]
She doesn't like reggaeton
But she loves the way la sensaci칩n sings (Yeah)
I didn't mean to (Yeah, yeah)
To get all the attention
I live in a mansion and I don't even know the address (Oh my God)
It's fucking hard, it's fucking hard
Daddy Arca, ask me for my blessing (Ah; aah!), prra
Fuck (Man), my house is a hotel and the view looks fuckin' great (Beautiful)
I can land a plane in it, all I need is the runway (Wow)
Impossible that this combination fails (No), de flow a mixed salad (Aha)
Suck-up, don't insist, when talking about greatness you're not on the list
No, neverland
I take them apart like Legoland (Yap, yah)
And if I point you out to my people, they'll give it to you (Pa-pa-pa)
And you're going inside, but in the van
From the neck up it's freezing cold (Oops)
I arrive and snow falls in the hood (Yessir)
Leaving these motherfuckers without a gift
Santa Claus with the essence of the Grinch in him (Rrra)
