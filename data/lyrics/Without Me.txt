[Intro: 
Obie Trice
 & Eminem]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Raâ€”
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo (Ooh, ooh)
[Refrain: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on 
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)
